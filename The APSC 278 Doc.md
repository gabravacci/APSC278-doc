This is intended as a companion/summary of the lecture slides, no images means you need to look them up appropriately. Any mistakes are my own.
### Chemical bonding
- Inter-atomic bonding is governed by electron structure
- More electronegative atoms (upper-right of periodic table) accept electrons more easily
- Primary bonds are strong
	- Ionic
		- Between metals and non-metals
		- Metals give atoms up to non-metals
		- Bond is *non-directional*
		- Bond energies high (600-1500 kJ/mol)
	- Covalent
		- Between atoms with small differences in electronegativity
		- Sharing of valence electrons
		- Bond is *directional*
		- Bond energies vary
	- Metallic
		- Metal atoms give up valence electron $\to$ sea of electrons
		- Electron cloud is conductive
		- Bond id *non-directional*
		- Bond energies vary
- Secondary bonds are generally weaker
	- Van der Waals bonds
		- Between *most* atoms and molecules
		- Random fluctuations in polarization
		- Very weak
	- Hydrogen bonds 
		- Strongest secondary bond
		- Between H and O, N, F(luorine)
		- Due to asymmetric charge distribution
- Polymers have covalent bonds
- Ceramics usually have ionic and covalent bonds
- Bond energies can only be compared between a bond type (i.e., $T_{m}\propto U_{bond}$ amongst a specific bond type)
### Elastic properties
- Elastic deformation is *non-permanent* and *reversible*
- Linear relationship between force and *elastic* deformation
	- Young’s Modulus $E$ is the slope
	- $\sigma = E\varepsilon$
	- Units (this gets asked for some reason)
		- $E [\ce{ Pa }]\equiv [\ce{N/m^{2}}]\equiv [\ce{ kg/ms^{2}] }\equiv [\ce{ J/m^{3} }]$
		- Strain is unit-less
- $E$ describes *stiffness*
- Resilience is the *recoverable* energy from elastic deformation
- **Modulus of Resilience**: Elastic area under stress-strain curve
	- Same units as $E$
	- $MOR=E\varepsilon _{y}^{2}/2=\sigma _{y}^{2}/2E$
- MOR increases with $\sigma _{Y}$ or decreased $E$
- Uniaxial tensile test
	- Measures $E$, $\sigma _{Y}$ and $\sigma _{\mathrm{UTS}}$
- True parameters use *instantaneous* measurements (that is, at location of deformation)
- Poisson’s Ration ($\nu$): Strain perpendicular to load
- Equilibrium interatomic distance: where $F(r_{0}) = dU/dr = 0$, useful for material properties because $E\propto dF/dr\vert_{r_{0}}$ 
	- Bond stiffness
- $E\propto T_{m}$
### Plastic properties
- Plastic deformation is *permanent*
- Beyond $\sigma _{Y}$
	- Heterogeneous: abrupt transition with upper and lower yield-point
		- Lueder’s bands: points of localized deformation deform plastically first
		- Happen because of pinned dislocations by composite atoms (carbon and steel, etc)
	- Homogeneous: Continuous undistinguishable point
		- Offset yield stress method to determine $\sigma _{Y}$
		- Shift strain by $0.002$ (convention) and plot linearly with slope $E$, intercept is $\sigma _{Y}$
- Definition: *work hardening* $\to$ increasing $\sigma _{Y}$ (i.e., extending the elastic limit)
- Maximum stress in stress-strain curve: $\sigma _{UTS}$
- Elastic deformation keeps happening even after elastic limit
	- Recoverable energy (area) approximated by slope ($E$) into intercept
- True stress up to necking: $\sigma _{T}=K\varepsilon _{T}^{n}$
	- $K$: strength coefficient
	- $n$: work hardening exponent
	- This is the work hardening equation $\to$ *true stress* (more below) up to necking point
- At $\sigma _{UTS}$ - *necking* process begins
	- Caused by pore cavities (defects)
	- Pores increase $\to$ reduced load $\to$ localized deformation $\to$ eventual failure
- IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS
	- *Ductility:* 
		- Amount of deformation before failure (expressed in % elongation or % reduction in area)
	- *Toughness:* 
		- Energy *absorbed* before $\sigma _{f}$, area under graph
		- Approximation: $\approx \frac{\sigma _{Y}+\sigma _{UTS}}{2}\varepsilon _{f}$
	- *Hardness:* 
		- resistance to *localized* plastic deformation
- Carbon composition in steel: Higher = more brittle, less tough, stronger (and vice versa)
- True stress and true strain:
	- Use *instantaneous* measurements (at time and local of deformation) as opposed to original ones
	- Just look at formula sheet equations
	- Both engineering quantities are *less* than their true counterparts $\to$ *conservative* estimates
- Safety factors: Factor of safety $N = \sigma _{Y}/\sigma _{w}$ where $\sigma _{w}$ is the *working stress* 
	- Ratio of yield stress to stress applied $\to$ high means stress applied much lower than yield = safe
- Hoop stress: $\sigma = \frac{r\Delta p}{t}$
- Hardness testing
	- Can’t be determined from tensile test
	- Values are relative, not absolute $\to$ depend on testing standards used (Rockwell, Brinell)
- Hardness is useful to estimate $\sigma _{Y}$
### Crystal structure
- DEFINITIONS:
	- *Crystalline material*:
		- Atoms arranged in repeating array, with long-range *order*
	- *Crystal structure:*
		- Spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystalline material
		- This determines material properties
	- *Crystal morphology*:
		- Shape and size of crystals or grains
- Unit cell: cube of average crystalline solid $\to$ defines the organization of atoms
	- Definitions:
		- Coordination number (CN): number of neighboring atoms 
		- Close packed direction: Direction with highest linear density (atoms touching)
		- Atomic packing factor (APF): volume of atoms / volume of unit
			- Using close packed direction, derive equations for sides of cube $a$ then $APF = \frac{n(4/3\pi R^{3})}{a^3}$
	- Face centered cubic (FCC)
		- 4 atoms in unit cell
		- CN = 12
		- APF = 0.74
		- Close packed direction: cube face = $4R$ $\to$ $a= 2\sqrt{ 2 }R$ 
	- Body centered cubic (BCC)
		- Self descriptive
		- 2 (total) atoms
		- CN = 8
		- APF = 0.68
		- Close packed direction: cube diagonal = $4R$ $\to$ allows us to determine volume in APF ($a = \frac{4R}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$)
	- Hexagonal close packed (HCP): fraud
		- 6 atoms
		- CN = 12
		- APF = 0.74
		- Close packed along hexagonal face direction
	- Easy pattern (thanks Daniel): 
		- BCC|FCC|HCP atoms = 2|4|6
		- for CN multiply by 4|3|2
		- APF is 0.68|0.74|0.74 
	- Theoretical density: $\rho _{Th}$ = mass of atoms in unit cell per volume
		- $\rho _{Th}=\frac{nA_{i}}{V_{c}N_{A}}$
		- $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s
		- $A_{i}$ is atomic weight in g/mol
		- Why is there a distinction?
- Crystallographic directions
	- Vectors pass through origin, can be translated freely
	- Directions represented by $[abc]$, $a$, $b$ and $c$ represent directions ($[\boldsymbol{xyz}]$)
	- E.g.: vector $\frac{a}{2}\boldsymbol{x}+b \boldsymbol{y}+0c \boldsymbol{z}\to \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}+1\boldsymbol{y}+0\to 1\boldsymbol{x}+2\boldsymbol{y}+0\to [120]$
	- In the square bracket representation minus signs go on top, i.e. $[2 \overline{1}0]$
	- Common ones are:
		- $[111]$: square diagonal
		- $[110]$: face diagonal
		- $[100]$: side
	- This stuff matters because $E$ depends on the crystallographic direction for *anisotropic* materials
- Planar density: depending on crystallographic direction in the unit cell
	- Calculation is: $PD = N_{plane}/A_{plane}$
	- FCC: $1/(4\sqrt{ 2 }R^2)$
	- BCC: $3/(8\sqrt{ 2 }R^2)$
- Crystal solidification
	- Nucleation $\to$ growing grains are oriented differently
	- Imperfect fits create *grain boundaries* which have high energy (because of disorder $U\propto \Omega$)
- Crystal Imperfections
	- Vacancies (gaps)
	- Interstitial (too grouped together?)
	- Equilibrium defect concentration obeys $N_{\nu}=N\exp\left( \frac{-Q_{\nu}}{RT} \right)$
		- $N$: atoms
		- $N_{\nu}$: number of vacancies per unit volume
		- $Q_{\nu}$: activation energy to create a vacancy
		- $R$: BOLTZMANN’s CONSTANT
- *Diffusion* (IMPORTANT)
	- Process of atoms moving within a solid — atoms move to vacancies or interstitial atoms move freely $\to$ *require* the existence of defects
	- Matters for the next modules
	- Allows atoms to re-arrange to lower energy configurations
- *Dislocations* (IMPORTANT):
	- Linear crystalline defects present in all materials, generated during fabrication or formation
	- Dislocations induce *elastic stress* and *strain fields*
	- Can only ned a grain boundaries or free surfaces
	- Dislocation density: $\rho = \ell/V$ (in $[\ce{ m/m^{3} }]$) where $\ell$ is total length of dislocation line and $V$ is volume
- Plastic deformation — crystal explanation
	- *Slipping*: movement of dislocations by severing and re-forming of atomic bonds (due to shear stress)
		- Minimized atomic distortion (?) with dislocation movement
		- Occurs along plane with *densest atomic packing* (the *slip* plane)
		- Slip direction has *highest linear density*
		- Causes slip lines in a crystal
		- Cause resultant/resolved shear stresses: $\tau _{R}=\sigma \cos \phi \cos\lambda$
			- $\sigma:$ applied stress
			- $\phi:$ angle between normal to slip plane
			- $\lambda:$ angle between slip and stress directions
		- Slip occurs along plane with maximum resolved shear stress, thus this guides the yield stress:
			- $\sigma _{Y}=\frac{\tau _{crss}}{\operatorname{max}(\cos \phi \cos\lambda)}
	- Dislocations move along slip plane causing plastic deformation
	- Dislocation movement introduces tensile stress below/above slip plane ($\intercal,\boldsymbol{\perp}$)
### Strengthening of crystals
- From previous: dislocation motion $\implies$ plastic deformation, thus stronger materials impede dislocation motion
- Grain size *reduction*:
	- Grain boundaries *impede* dislocation motion:
		- because dislocations must change direction and atomic disorder makes slip planes discontinuous
	- Hall-Petch equation relates yield strength and grain size ($d$, diameter):
		- $\sigma _{Y}=\sigma _{0}+k_{y}\frac{1}{\sqrt{ d }}$
		- $\sigma_{0},\,k_{y}:$ material properties
		- Reveals $\sigma _{Y}\propto ^{-1}d$
	- Smaller grains $\implies$ larger grain boundary *area* 
- Solid-Solution strengthening
	- Mixes of two different types of atoms
	- *Substitutional solutes*: Alloy atom has similar size to original ones, replacing them in crystal structure
		- Impose *lattice strain* that impede dislocation motion
		- Smaller create tensile stresses attracting upper side of dislocation
		- Larger create compressive stresses attracting lower side of dislocation
		- Both pin dislocation down, by reducing its strain and requiring more energy to dissociate
	- *Interstitial solutes*: Alloy atom is smaller and fits into gaps (Steel Fe-C)
- Work hardening (or cold working)
	- Below melting point
	- Up to yielding: $\sigma _{T}=K\varepsilon _{T}^{n}$
	- Metal becomes stronger as it deforms plastically 
	- Plastic deformation increases dislocation density $\to$ dislocation-dislocation interactions which difficult dislocation motion (because they’re attractive)

*** 
### Recrystallization and grain growth
- Hot vs. cold working
	- Define *homologous temperature* as $T_{H} + \frac{T_{deform}}{T_{melt}}$
	- For pure metals, if $T_{H} < 0.4$ we get cold working, else it’s hot working
	- For alloys, that number is $0.6$. 
		- This is higher for alloys because solutes strengthen it by inducing strain in the crystal structure $\to$ impeding dislocation $\to$ higher energy required to relieve strain
	- **How to determine:** 
		- Given a temperature $T$ and a melting point $\widetilde{T}$, first determine wether alloy or metal, then calculate homologous temperature by: $T_{H} = \frac{T}{T + \widetilde{T}}$ and compare to see if its cold or hot working.
- Lattice strain and dislocation motion:
	- Given a *substitutional atom* we have two types of interaction:
		- Alloy atoms move (diffuse) to dislocation to reduce strain imposed by it, energy required (for diffusion from low strain)
		- Strain field interactions (**repulsive** in cold working) in adjacent dislocations
- Rolling and extrusion:
	- Process of *work hardening* (at cold working) by rolling and extruding a metal, with decrease in ductility
	- What happens to the grains?
		- increased dislocation number and density $\implies$ strain in crystal lattice (above)
		- This means dislocation motion is more difficult $\equiv$ stronger
- Annealing heat treatment 
	- Reverses effects of work hardening (see above)
	- The internal energy from work hardening is in energy per unit length of dislocation times dislocation density ($\frac{U}{L} \times \rho$) (meaningless formula)
	- Three stages
		- Recovery:
			- Release of stored energy by dislocation motion from *enhanced* atomic diffusion (?)
			- Dislocations go to lower strain energy
		- Recrystallization:
			- Is driven by *internal energy of material* **IMPORTANT** 
			- Dislocation free grains nucleate at grain boundaries, these are softer (lower $\sigma_{Y}$) because:
				- Lower dislocation density
			- New grains are balls basically
			- *Recrystallization temperature:* inversely proportional to cold work, temp. at which recrx. takes $\sim$ one hour.
			- [!] **EXPLAIN SLIDE 17 AND 26**
			- Material is unstable $\to$ wants to go to lower state
			- Thermally activated: $t_{recrx} \propto \frac{1}{Ae^{-Q/RT}}$ (time for 100% recrystallized)
				- This $Q$ (act. energy) decreases with cold work $\implies$ recrx. rate increases with cold work 
		- Grain growth: 
			- Boundaries have high disorder = high energy
			- After recrx. grains boundaries are *reduced*
			- Follows equation: $d^{n}-d_{0}^{n}= Kt$ 
				- $K,n$ constants
				- $d$ is grain size ($d_{0}$ init.)
				- $t$ is time
- WE DID IT
### Fracture
- Comparison to ductile fracture
	- Happens to *brittle* materials $\implies$ low toughness, little plastic deformation
	- Fracture surface is shiny and crystalline 
	- More *macroscopic* evidence (lack of dimples) resulting from *cleavage* (lol) of grains, translates into chevron and fan patterns under shear loading
- Brittle fracture process
	1. Necking 
	2. Cavities enlarge
	3. Cavities combine to form a *crack*
	4. Crack propagates
	5. Finally, when stress can’t be sustained, fracture
- All materials contain defects
	- Notably dislocations
	- Porosity, inclusions, surface damage etc.
- Fracture toughness $K_{C}$
	- Measures material’s resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present (material property)
	- defined by $Y \sigma_{c} \sqrt{ \pi a }$ (same critical stress as Griffith’s)
	- Different $K_{C}$ depending on loading:
		- Plane strain (“spreading the crack apart”) is most common, no residual strain in back and front faces
			- $K_{I}$ intensity factor at some $\sigma < \sigma_{c}$ can determine crack propagation
		- Others are *sliding* and *tearing*. 
	- Fracture toughness *decreases* with yield strength ($\propto ^{-1}$)
	- plugus and chugus
- Why cracks (lol) matter:
	- High stress concentrations near the crack (small area)
	- Note how a ductile material can *yield* at the crack tip instead of concentrating stress
- Crack definition and equations
	- Radius of curvature is $\rho_{t}$
	- Length of crack is depends on crack location
		- *Surface crack* will have a length of $a = L$
		- *Internal crack* will have a length of $a = \frac{L}{2}$
	- Stress at a position far removed from the crack is called *nominal* and described by $\sigma_{o} = \frac{F}{A_{o}}$ 
		- Can also calculate net section stress by considering area at crack level
	- Maximum stress is $\sigma_{m} = 2\sigma_{o}\sqrt{ \frac{a}{\rho_{t}} }$ 
	- Stress concentration factor $K_{t} = \frac{\sigma_{m}}{\sigma_{o}} = 2\sqrt{ \frac{a}{\rho_{t}} }$ 
- Griffith Theory for crack propagation
	- release of elastic strain energy
	- propagation happens when that release is *greater* than the energy required to form a new crack (this is Griffith’s theory)
	- residual energy goes into forming new crack surfaces
	- equation: $\sigma_{c}=\sqrt{ \frac{2E\gamma_{s}}{\pi a} }$
		- $\sigma_{c}$ critical stress
		- $\gamma_{s}$ specific surface energy (?)
- Charpy Impact Test
	- High strain rate, low temp, triaxial stress?
	- Notch on sample
	- Study on brittle fracture because of crack stress concentration
### Fatigue
- Cyclic loading properties
	- Mean stress: $\sigma_{m}=\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}+\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}}{2}$
	- Stress range: $\sigma_{r}=\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}$
	- Stress amplitude: $\sigma_{a} = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}}{2}$
	- Stress ratio: $R = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}}$
	- Note how (1) is inversely proportional to (3), higher mean stress means lower stress amplitude
- S-N curves and interpretation
	- Defines *fatigue strength* and *fatigure failure*
	- *Fatigue limit*: Stress amplitude where failure will not occur
		- Not necessarily exact due to the defects present in all material mentioned in the previous sections
- Fatigue failure
	- Cyclic stress $\to$ crack nucleation and growth (but need tensile stress) 
	- As above, failure occurs when crack grows $> K_{c}$
	- Cracks start at usual stress concentration points, notches, scratches etc.
		- Beachmarks (visible) reflect crack propagation (rate)
		- Striations (micro) reflect load cycles
	- Occurs when stress is dynamic and/or varying (also below $\sigma_{Y}$)
	- Usually after *long time* (DIE LIT??) of cyclic stress (see above)
	- Three stages:
		1. Initiation
		2. Propagation
		3. Final fracture
- Surface treatment
	- SHOT-PEENING: 
		- Shooting hard (read: small metal balls) at a metallic surface inducing residual *compressive* stresses which delay crack mitigation
		- [?] Why does adding small compressive stresses resist crack formation?
	- Case hardening:
		- Harden the surface of a metal object without affecting toughness underneath by exposing the metal to a C/N rich atmosphere at high T creating a layer rich in those components through atomic diffusion
	- Get rid of stupid edges (fillets)
### Fracture and DBT (more like BDT)
- Main definition: 
	- Drastic reduction in ductility within a temperature range
		- Observed in some BCC steels, BCC metals and generic ceramics and polymers but NOT on FCC metals (at all)
- %elongation/temperature graph showcases the DBT temperature, where the ‘S’ curves upward, prior to the DBT it is *brittle* and after it is *ductile*
- Higher *strain rate* increases the DBTT and temperature range where it is brittle
- Shoopy impact test:
	- Conducted at high strain rate (brittle over larger ranges), low T and triaxial stress (meaningless)
	- Standard notch size
	- Big hammer slams specimen opposite to notch
	- Can be understood as a transition in potential energy ($V_{f}- V_0$)
	- Does not measure any material property
Key info: ductile fracture $\implies$ dislocation movement while brittle fracture $\implies$ crack propagation
### Creep
- Definition:
	- Creep is *time-dependent* and permanent *deformation* of materials subjected to constant load at elevated temperatures ($T > 0.4T_{m}$)
- Creep regimes:
	- Primary:
		- Continuously decreasing creep rate due to strain hardening (work)
	- Secondary: Constant creep rate $\varepsilon_{s}$ due to balancing of strain hardening and recovery, lasts the longest
	- Tertiary: Acceleration of creep rate until rupture
- Components of creep are $\varepsilon_{E} + \varepsilon_{P}+\varepsilon_{C}$ instantaneous elastic, plastic and time-dependent creep strain
- Creep curve is proportional to temperature and stress 
	- Steeper curve means higher stress as $\dot{\varepsilon}_{s}=K_{1}\sigma ^{n}$
	- With temperature considered: $\dot{\varepsilon}_{s} = K_{2}\sigma ^{n}\exp(-Q/RT)$
- Larson-Miller parameter
	- Short term creep experiments require higher temperatures extrapolated 
	- Extrapolation criteria is $m = T(C +\log(t_{r}))$, graphs usually plot $m-\sigma$
- Creep resistance:
	- High melting temperature, elastic modulus and grain size 
	- Grain boundaries matter at high T because larger grains have less surface area for sliding
### Corrosion of Metals
- Environmental degradation is degradation of material properties due to environment exposure
	- High temperatures
	- Reduce reactants (water, oxygen)
	- Corrosion inhibitors?
- Corrosion is a specific type of above, specifically unchecked electrochemical attack of a metal resulting in its *oxidation*. The result is more chemically stable
- SKIPPED
- Driving force is *reduction* of energy to mineral state
- Process
	- Electrochemical cell?
- Stress corrosion:
	- Crack propagation
- Galvanic corrosion
	- Metals or alloys electrically coupled (CONTACT) or exposed to electrolyte (substance that conducts electricity when dissolved, like water)
	- More reactive metal is *oxidized*, this is the anode, this is what *corrodes* (!!!)
	- Less reactive metal is *reduced*, this is the cathode
	- Protection:
		- Formation of protective oxide
		- Noble coating
		- Sacrificial (cathodic) coating
			- Name is stupid because you’re adding an anode (cathodic because you make the thing you’re *protecting* the cathode, but why is it coating? c’mon now)
			- Use lower element in galvanic series, will act as the anode $\to$ *corrodes* first
### Phase Diagrams
- Phase: homogeneous portion of a system with uniform physical and chemical characteristics
- Depict only *equilibrium conditions*
- Binary Isomorphous Systems:
	- *Binary* $\to$ two elements
	- *Isomorphous* $\to$ liquid and solid regions have one phase
	- In between the phase lines (for $T$ and composition) we find a mixed phase $\alpha + L$ 
	- **Cu-Ni system**
		- Phases are: $\alpha, L$ 
- Phase composition
	- In two phase region with composition $C_{0}$ we draw a horizontal line at temperature of interest, the *tie line* and the two intersections give the phase boundaries $C_{\alpha}$ and $C_{L}$
- **ANALYSIS:**
	- Tie line: In two phase regions, allows us to determine the composition of each *phase*, graph overall gives composition *total*
	- Lever rule:
		1. Mark intersection of tie line with phase boundaries
		2. Mass fraction of phase is length of tie line on *opposite* side of the overall composition / overall tie line length
- Non equilibrium cooling: 
	- little diffusion in solid, instantaneous in liquid
	- little compositional changes over time (no diffusion hoe) $\to$ *cored structures*: solid particles have more concentration than other regions
- Binary Eutectic System (Cu-Ag System):
	- mixture of chemical compounds that have a *single* chemical composition that solidifies at a lower temperature than all its constituents
	- Single phase fields
		- $\alpha -$Cu rich solid
		- $\beta-$Ag rich solid
		- Liquid
	- Mixed phase fields
		- $\alpha +$liquid
		- $\beta +$liquid
		- $\alpha + \beta$ mixed solid
	- Lines:
		- $\alpha \setminus \alpha+L :$ *Solidus* line ($\alpha$ or $\beta$)
		- $L \setminus \alpha + L$: *Liquidus* line ($\alpha$ or $\beta$)
		- $\alpha \setminus \alpha + \beta$: *Solvus* line
	- The defining *euctetic point* is the point where the liquidus lines for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ meet. It is the easiest point to go from a solid to a liquid.
	- Interesting regions:
		- Entirely in the $\alpha-$phase upon cooling would result in a small $\alpha +L$ region, with complete solidification at the solidus $\to$ characterizes a *polycrystalline* alloy
		- Crossing the solvus line: Similar changes to above until solvus line, where $\alpha$ solid solubility is exceed, where the region is $\alpha + \beta$ with small $\beta$ particles (composite) $\to$ somewhat *composite alloy*. 
		- Across the euctetic point: liquid until euctetic temperature, where liquid becomes $\alpha + \beta$ phase (atomic diffusion) $\to$ microstructure of fine alternating layers of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases called *lamellae*.
			- Why? Instant transformation into solid-solid phase can only happen with atomic diffusion over a *short temperature* range and so a small distance range(?).
		- Compositions passing through the eucectic line but not through the point: 
			- Lower than the eutectic: *hypoeutectic* $\to$ Eutectic lamellar structure with a primary $\alpha$
			- Higher than the eutectic: *hypereutectic* $\to$ Eutetic lamellar structure with primary $\beta$
			- Use *lever rule* to calculate mass fractions + tie line
- Fe-Fe$_3$C Phase Diagram:
	- Right boundary $\to$ *cementite* ($\ce{ Fe_{3}C }$) solid line as well (6.7 wt% C)
	- Eutectoid region $\to$ single-phase solid *austenite* ($\gamma$)
	- $\alpha$: Ferrite
	- $\alpha + \gamma:$ 
	- $\gamma+\ce{ Fe_{3}C }$
	- $\gamma + L$
	- $\ce{ Fe_{3}C } + L$
	- Eutectoid point: transition from $\gamma \to \alpha + \ce{ Fe_{3}C }$ called *pearlite*, lamellar microstructure, in between soft and ductile ferrite and brittle and hard cementite.

### Heat treatment of metals
- Relieve stresses from dislocations and grain boundaries
- Manipulates the microstructure $\implies$ material properties
- *Temperature* and *time* of heat treatment determine the result (TTT diagram)
- Tempering involves reheating to regain ductility and toughness
- Quenching and tempering of steel process
	- Eutectoid = austenite
	1. Austenitize
		- Heats to 100% austenite region (held)
	2. Quench
		- Splash with water or oil to rapidly cool
		- Forms non-equilibrium, *hard* microstructures
		- Isothermal transformation diagram 
			- For eutectoid steel
			- % pearlite vs. log(time)
			- rate of transformation depends on *temperature*
			- the further from eutectoid isotherm (727) the faster the process (higher transformation rate)
	3. Temper
		- Reheat to some intermediary (200-550)
		- Decreases hardness, regains (some) ductility
- TTT diagrams (also for quenching)
	- Time-temperature transformation diagram
	- From isothermal transformation diagram, extract start, halfway and end time
	- Repeat for many different temperatures
- Non-equilibrium microstructures
	- From austenite *ONLY* (competitive structures = only one possible result unless reheated):
		- Bainite
			- Needle-like
			- “Carbon diffuses into distinct pearlite layers” (?)
			- Quenching $\to$ fast $\to$ no time for diffusion (slow) resulting in thin needles (of cementite) in a ferrite matrix, instead of lamellae
			- High cooling rate (quenched to 210-520 C)
		- Martensite
			- *Very* rapid cooling, essentially 0 time for diffusion
			- Supersaturated and unstable
			- Lattice “stuck” between FCC and BCC (BCT)
			- Hardest and strongest, most brittle 
			- Also between 210-520 C
		- Tempered Martensite
			- Diffusion governed?
			- The BCT (ferrite) phase transforms to BCC phase
			- Fine distribution of cementite particles ($<\mu \ce{ m }$)in ferrite matrix
			- High hardness still but now greater ductility
	- From pearlite
		- Spheroidite (tempered pearlite)
			- Reheat pearlite to high temperature (< 727 C) for enough time
			- Cementite layers become dispersion of spheres
			- Less phase boundary area $\implies$ less strength, more ductility
			- Spheres are bigger than particles
### Polymers
- Plastics: synthetic (ish)
- Natural polymers: Derived from existing biological processes
- Polymers are differentiated by the repeating unit/backbone chain (*monomers*)
	- Carbon backbone: C-C bonds 
- Common side chain effects
	- Larger (carbon) side groups $\implies$ difficulty in bond rotation (strength+)
	- Intermolecular interactions
- Molecular weights:
	- *Number-average*: Histogram of number of chains at a given interval ($\overline{M_{n}} = \sum x_{i}M_{i}$)
	- *Weight-average:* Histogram of the total mass of the chains at a given interval ($\overline{M_{w}}=\sum w_{i}M_{i}$)
	- $\overline{M_{w}}>\overline{M_{n}}$
- Degree of polymerization (DP): average number of *mer* units in a chain: $DP = n_{n} = \overline{M_{n}}/m$
	- Higher DP $\implies$ higher melting point, stiffness, strength
- Polymer branching
	- Less branching means the molecules pack better and so intermolecular forces are *stronger*
- Crosslinking
	- Adjacent linear chains are *strong* 
	- Achieved by additive atoms/molecules *covalently* bonded to the chains (usually *non*-reversible)
- Crystallinity
	- As usual: long-range order in a material
	- Opposite is amorphous (usually branched)
		- Covalent bonds to backbone, van der Waals interactions between chains
	- Polymers are usually semicrystalline
	- High crystallinity:
		1. Resistant to softening by heating ($T_{m}$)
		2. Denser (packing)
		3. Opaque
		4. Stronger/stiffer
		5. Less ductile/more brittle
	 - Increased crystallinity $\implies$ increase density via packing
	 - Require sparse side groups, low branching and low random distribution of sidechains (but random mers)
- Glass transition temperature
	- Melting point $\iff$ high crystallinity
	- Point where rigid solid (glass) structure forms (below $T_{m}$)
- Example: LDPE x HDPE
	- High Deg. of branching x Low branching (or even linear)
	- density LDPE < density HDPE
	- Low crystalline x High crystalline
	- Flexible, transparent x Semi-flexible (high tensile strength)
- Most are sensitive to temperature
- Very varied stress-strain curves
	- Similarities: 
		- Elastic deformation $\to$ plastic deformation
		- Presence of upper yield point and lower yield point
	 - Differences
		 - Neck *propagates* through test section
			 - Why?
				 - Recall they’re usually *semi*-crystalline
				 - Amorphous region aligns to form a neck (*conditioning*)
				 - Conditioning causes *local strengthening* 
				 - Neck doesn’t elongate further, just other amorphous regions keep necking 
			- Occurs for non-deformed or polymers with weak intermolecular interactions (chains)
	 - Uniaxial tensile test can change translucency in polyethylene (crystalline $\to$ amorphous)
	 - Polymer chains align along tensile axis, can be undone with re-heating.
- Stages of conditioning
	 1. Chain folded lamellar structure (amorphous)
	 2. Inter-lamellar chains elongate (aligned with load)
	 3. Conditioning begins after continuous elongation of amorphous tie chains
	 4. Lamellae separate into smaller crystalline segments (smaller crystalline regions connected by chains)
	 5. Smaller crystalline segments begin to separate as well
- Drawing
	- Polymer is strengthened by plastic deformation under tension
	- Strengthens along axis of loading
	- Weakens perpendicular to axis of loading
- Thermoplastics
	- Soften when heated (more fluid)
	- Molecular motions overcome intermolecular forces
	- Rigid when cooled (recyclable) 
- Thermosets
	- Cross-linked
	- Temperature resistant
- < | > | >? | > | = (<)
- Elastomers
	- Can withstand large elastic strains at ambient temperatures
	- Crosslinking gives more stability
	- Usually *also* thermosets 
### Composites
- Materials with more than one phase present
	- Formally: Artificially constructed multiphase material constituted by chemically dissimilar phases
- Ex:
	- Wood: cellulose fibers (flexible) surrounded by *lignin* (stiffer)
	- Unreinforced concrete: aggregate particles surrounded by mix of cement and water
	- GFRP: glass fibers surrounded by polymer matrix
	- Plywood: wood sheets aligned with grain directions at right angles (glued)
	- Bone: soft and strong protein collagen and hard and brittle mineral 
	- Eutectoid steel (pearlite): Ferrite and Cementite
- Common artificial construction:
	- The *matrix* phase and the *dispersed or reinforcing* phase
		 - Particle reinforcing
		 - Fiber reinforcing
		 - Structural
	 - Matrix properties
		 - Matrix is commonly low density, relatively ductile 
		 - Matrix must bind to fiber well
	 - Fiber properties
		 - High strength (unlikely to have flaws)
		 - Long chains orient themselves during production leading to strong covalent C—C bonds 
		 - Carbon fiber high specific modulus and strength, semi-crystalline 
- Fiber-Reinforced composites
	- Reinforced phase consisting of *fibers* (duh)
	- Goal usually high strength-weight ratios
	- Fibers are stronger than continuous (matrix) phase $\to$ handle most of applied load
	- Fiber properties affect composite properties the most
	- Matrix protects fibers from damage/crack creation and propagation (amongst fibers)
	- Matrix-fiber bond needs to be strong
	- Fiber length $\propto$ stress carrying capacity
		- [ ] $l_{c} = {\sigma _{f}d}/{\tau _{c}}$
		-  $d$ fiber diamater
		- $\sigma _{f}$ fiber strength in tension
		- $\tau _{c}$ shear stress in fiber-matrix interface
		- for continuous fiber, the length must be greater than $15 \times \sigma _{f}d/\tau _{c}$
	- Fiber orientation
		- Mat: random
		- Quasi-isotropic: alternating layers of $0-90^{\circ}$ and $\pm 45^{\circ}$ 
		- Parallel layer fabric
		- [ ]  Fibers are stronger when oriented parallel to the load $\implies$ $45^{\circ}$ can handle higher loads before failure (as oppose to a $0-90^{\circ}$ grid)
- Structural composites
	- Sandwich
	- Two stiff, strong outer sheets encase thick layer of less dense, weak and flexible material (commonly honeycomb style) connected by an adhesive layer
	- Outer material handles compressive and tensile stresses (thick), inner material offers continuous support so must have high shear strength
	- Stiffness-weight ratio 
		- Specific modulus: $E/\rho$
		- Better variation: $E^{1/3}/\rho \propto$ stiffness-weight ratio
		- $E = 4FL^{3}/\delta wb^{3}$ ($F$ force, $\delta$ deflection, $w$ width, $b$ thickness, $L$ length)
- Wood
	- Highly crystalline cellulose fiber cells held together by *lignin*, naturally crosslinked polymer
	- Highly anisotropic: Strong in longitudinal tension, slightly weaker in longitudinal compression ($\sim 50\%$) and much weaker otherwise
	- Weak in traverse compression because cellulose-lignin bond is weak
	- In compression the cellulose cells collapse, increasing hardness and density
- Long fiber composite materials are *anisotropic* (direction dependent)
	- $c$ refers to composite, $m$ refers to matrix, $f$ refers to fiber
	- $V_{m}+V_{f} = 1$ (important)
	- Isostrain analysis
		- Fibers oriented parallel to force
		- Under load: $\varepsilon _{c}=\varepsilon _{m}=\varepsilon _{f}$
		- Total load: $F_{c} = F_{f} + F_{m}\equiv \sigma _{c}A_{c} = \sigma _{f}A_{f}+\sigma _{m}A_{m}$
		- Gives: $E_{c} = E_{f}V_{f} + E_{m}V_{m}$ (best case)
		- $\frac{F_{f}}{F_{m}}=\frac{E_{f}V_{f}}{E_{m}V_{m}}$
	- Isostress analysis
		- Fiber oriented perpendicular to force
		- Load: $\sigma _{c} = \sigma _{m} = \sigma _{f}$
		- Fibers as *layers* (simpler model)
		- $E_{c}=\frac{E_{m}E_{f}}{E_{m}V_{f}+E_{f}V_{m}}$ (worst case)
		- $F_{f}/F_{m} = 1$: Fiber and matrix evenly share load
	- Compare $E_{c}$ in both cases to determine anisotropic properties
	- Fiber orientation is done to facilitate fabrication (random fiber orientation beneficial if load application is unknown)
	- Anisotropic stress-strain graphs
		- Sketch fiber and matrix phase separately
		- Fiber is totally brittle (*brittle failure*), matrix is ductile
		- Line for both follows two stages
			1. Both fibers and matrix deform elastically (up to matrix $\sigma _{Y}$)
			2. Matrix undergoes *plastic* deformation (up to fiber brittle failure point)
		- From 1 $\to$ 2, fibers handle greater proportion of load (IF bond between phases stays)
